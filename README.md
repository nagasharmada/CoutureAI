## CoutureAI â€“ AI-Powered Fashion Visualization Tool

## Overview
CoutureAI is a generative AI tool that allows users to visualize how custom-designed clothing would look on a person before actual production or purchase. By accepting natural language inputs describing color, fabric, garment type, and other parameters, the system uses a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to generate realistic images of individuals wearing the specified outfit. This tool is designed for both everyday users and fashion designers who need to quickly prototype and visualize styles.

## Key Features

**1.**Generative Design: Generates high-resolution images of people wearing clothes based on input attributes like type, color, sleeve style, fabric, and gender.

**2.**Text-to-Image Conversion: Uses Hugging Face's implementation of the Stable Diffusion v2.1 model to convert descriptive prompts into visuals.

**3.**Interactive Interface: Built with Gradio, allowing real-time interaction with customization options through a user-friendly UI.

**4.**Multi-Angle Visualization: Supports different view angles (front, side, back) and scene backgrounds (e.g., plain white, runway, studio).

**5.**Style Summary & Suggestions: Automatically generates textual fashion suggestions and descriptions based on selected inputs.
