# CoutureAI – AI-Powered Fashion Visualization Tool

## 🧵 Overview

**CoutureAI** is a generative AI tool that allows users to visualize how custom-designed clothing would look on a person before actual production or purchase.  
By accepting natural language inputs describing color, fabric, garment type, and other parameters, the system uses a pre-trained **Stable Diffusion** model to generate realistic images of individuals wearing the specified outfit.

This tool is ideal for:
- Fashion designers needing rapid prototyping.
- Everyday users curious about personalized outfit visualization.
